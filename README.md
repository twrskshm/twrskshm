# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Saksham Tiwari.
## About Me
I'm a software engineer specializing in distributed data systems. My learning approach involves deep diving into complex 
open-source projects by thoroughly reading documentation, analyzing code for low-level details, and replicating entire 
projects.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) sparked my interest in Machine Learning. I have recently ventured into 
data scraping, cleaning, representation, model creation, and performance analysis, although I am still a beginner in 
this field.

Driven by my competitive nature, I enjoy participating in programming contests, playing First Person Shooting (FPS) 
games, and engaging in chess matches.
